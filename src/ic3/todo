=====================

Finishing integration
with ebmc
=====================

*) Add processing external constraints (like AIGER format constraints
   that are handled by the current stand-alone version of IC3)

*) Add the ability to specify multiple properties (like this is done
   in the current stand-alone version of IC3)

*) Add code freeing memory allocated by the Verilog reader after IC3
   converted this information into its internal data
   structure. (Keeping this memory is too expensive for large
   examples.)

*) Add the ability to specify parameters that control the stand-alone
   version of IC3


=====================================
Changes of the current implementation
=====================================

*) Print out more time-frame statistics  (time taken
   to finish a time frame, average size of inductive clauses,
   averages size of cubes generalizing bad states etc)

*) Optimize the procedure of building the longest inductive clause for
   the case of designs with a large number of latches

*) Try more aggressive generalization of a bad state (on top
   of using the state-lifting technique)

*) Implement actual removal of subsumed clauses (currently they are
   just marked and ignored by the algorithm)


====================================
Improvements of the basic algorithm
====================================

*) Implement the version of IC3 that fixes the problem with
   convergence rate (by computing reachability of good states breaking
   induction)

*) Implement a "dual" IC3 where one over-approximates the set of
   states from which a bad state is reachable in j transitions (rather
   than the set of states reachable in j transitions from initial
   states).

*) Implement a version of IC3 where one employs depth-first search
